This Tic Tac Toe game is a graphical 4x4 grid-based version developed using Python's Tkinter library, where a human player competes against a simple AI. The interface includes a 4x4 board of clickable buttons, a title, and a restart option. The game alternates turns between the human (represented by 'x') and the AI (represented by 'o'), with the AI selecting moves randomly from available spots. It checks for winning combinations across rows, columns, and diagonals, and also detects draws when all cells are filled without a winner. Upon winning or drawing, a message is displayed, and players can restart the game to play again.
